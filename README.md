# SASS_Gusteaus-Restaurant
SASS Proyect I developed to showcase my SASS skills for Naranja X IT academy.

Please take a look at it: https://lautarojgarcia177.github.io/SASS_Gusteaus-Restaurant/

In this project i used SASS (I was tired of ";" so i wanted to give it a try and i liked it)

## Sass files description:
#### main.sass
Main sass file which gets transpiled into css, here i @use all the partials
#### _animations.sass
Partial where i put all the animations
#### _base.sass
Partial where i put variables, placeholdes, common classes like font-size and mixings
#### _components.sass
Partial where where the "heavy lifting" goes, here i put all the classes and id styles
#### _layout.sass
Partial where i put the utilities for layout like flex and spacing
#### _reset.sass
Partial where that makes browsers render all elements more consistently

## JS
Also, a little JS was used to control scrolling and background image transitions
